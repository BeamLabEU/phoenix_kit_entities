  I067: `config/test.exs` lets `PGDATABASE` override this repo's isolated
  test DB name. Ecto.Migrator's `schema_migrations` bookkeeping table is
  keyed only by version number, with no package namespace — pointing
  `PGDATABASE` at a database another package's migrator already owns makes
  same-numbered migrations from this package silently get treated as
  "already applied" and never run (confirmed live via `Ecto.Migrator.run/4`
  in the I067 recon, same mechanism as `phoenix_kit_crm`'s copy of this
  module). This stamps a `COMMENT ON TABLE schema_migrations` marker naming
  the owning package, and refuses to proceed if a stamped marker names
  someone else.

  Only engages when `PGDATABASE` is explicitly set — the default, isolated
  per-repo DB is unaffected either way.
